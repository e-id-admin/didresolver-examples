# DEPRECATED

For the upcoming launch of the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure we created a new organisation [swiyu-admin-ch](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch). 

This repository will be archived in the near term. New releases are published under [https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didresolver-examples](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didresolver-examples).
